## Find the newest addition to your family!

Everyone loves pets and looking for one can be daunting. Our app is specifically focused on cat adoption for cat lovers! Our app allows users to view all the cats that are up for adoption and create a profile page where they could favorite their potential pet choice that they could come back to later. 

Cat-App is a fully functioning MERN-stack single-page application built with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save cats, adopt cats.
